## Peter Rhodes - CV
Junior Full-Stack Javascript developer

I am a full-stack Javascript developer and have just graduated from the Founders & Coders bootcamp. I am interested in software development opportunities and specialise in web development with JavaScript and Node.js.

I have a background in design and aspire to become a great developer who can add value to a team by providing design and artworking skills alongside coding.

The tech for good sector is a real interest of mine. I would love to work on projects with a positive social impact, which aim to create a more equal and fair society or a more sustainable environment. 

I have created a website for my CV which can be found [here](https://rhodespeter.github.io/cv-website/) (a work in progress!).
