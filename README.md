## Peter Rhodes - CV
A downloadable version of this CV can be found [here](https://rhodespeter.github.io/portfolio/cv)

I am a full-stack Javascript developer and have just graduated from the 16 week Founders & Coders bootcamp.

I have a background in design and aspire to become a great developer who can add value to a team by providing strong design and artworking skills alongside coding.

The tech for good sector is a real interest of mine. I would love to work on projects with a positive social impact, which aim to create a more equal and fair society or a more sustainable environment.
